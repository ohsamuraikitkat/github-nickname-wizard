## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Design

* Directly modifies the DOM to add display names to GitHub interfaces
* Prevents duplicate replacements by adding `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-nickname-injected`) to processed elements
* Uses `MutationObserver` to monitor page content changes and process dynamically loaded elements
* Stores name mappings and settings in `chrome.storage.local`
* Provides an intuitive popup UI for managing nicknames and settings
* Context menu implementation allows for quick username registration right from GitHub pages
* Leverages GitHub's public API to automatically suggest real names for users as nickname candidates
* In Strict Mode, checks if the current URL matches registered patterns and only displays nicknames on matching pages
* Supports three URL matching methods: exact match, wildcard patterns, and regular expressions
* Enhanced security with proper Content Security Policy implementation for Manifest V3 compliance
