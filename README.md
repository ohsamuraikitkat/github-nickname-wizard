## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Briefly)

*   The extension directly modifies the GitHub page content (DOM) to insert nicknames.
*   It uses `data-*` attributes on elements to avoid applying nicknames multiple times.
*   It uses `MutationObserver` to detect page changes and apply nicknames to dynamically loaded content.
*   Nickname mappings and settings are stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

*   Nicknames are stored **locally** in your browser. They are **not** shared and **cannot** be seen by other users.
*   If GitHub changes its website structure, the extension might temporarily stop working correctly. We will try to provide updates to adapt to such changes when possible.
